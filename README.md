# The Quiz Arms
![The Quiz Arms Banner](documentation/the-quiz-arms-banner.png)


Test your general knowledge and get pub quiz ready!

Pub Quizzes are played all around the world, but they are especially popular in the UK. It is estimated that over half the pubs in the UK host a regular quiz night, thats roughly 23,600 pubs!

[YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/lifestyle/explore/activity/Pub_quizzes) show that 98% of people surveyed have heard of a pub quiz, and are rated as the 19th most popular social activity.

During lockdowns pub quizzes remained popular - they just changed format to become virtual. This gave me the idea of creating a quiz site that would feel like a pub quiz, where users could play on their own to improve their general knowledge anywhere and at any time.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users. Red and green  are very typical colours in traditional British public houses, with the red & green used for upholstery.

* I have used #f5f5f5 & #000000 as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.
* I have used #292929 as the overlay used over the sites background image.
* I have used # a50c3c for the border of the modal and to display the wrong answers.
* I have used #047638 to display the correct answer.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Almendra](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Almendra?preview.text=The%20Quiz%20Arms%20THE%20QUIZ%20ARMS&preview.text_type=custom&query=almendra). Almendra is based on a calligraphy style and I have chosen it as it looks like the type of font you would see on a pubs name sign, slightly medieval looking and grand.

![Almendra Font Example](documentation/almendra.webp)

* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?preview.text=The%20Quiz%20Arms%20THE%20QUIZ%20ARMS&preview.text_type=custom&query=quicksand). QuickSand is a sans-serif font which has lovely clean lines. I have chosen to use a sans-serif font for the body of the page as studies have found that sans-serif fonts are generally more legible to read on a screen.

![Quicksand Font Example](documentation/quicksand.webp)

### Imagery

As the website is called The Quiz Arms, I wanted to use an image for the page background of a pub to give the user the feeling that they are participating in a pub quiz.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

![Difficulty Page](documentation/wireframes/difficultywireframe.webp)
![Game Page](documentation/wireframes/gamewireframe.webp)
![High Scores Page](documentation/wireframes/highscorewireframe.webp)

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, a games page, a high scores page and a 404 error page.

All Pages on the website have:

* A favicon in the browser tab. ![favicon](documentation/favicon-image.webp)

Future Implementations.

* In future implementations I would like to give the user of the site more choice as to how many questions are in their quiz.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
