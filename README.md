### Typography

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
