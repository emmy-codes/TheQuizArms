# **The Quiz Arms Testing**

* [W3C Validator](#W3C-Validator)
* [JavaScript Validator](#JavaScript-Validator)
* [Testing User Stories](#Testing-User-Stories)
* [Lighthouse](#Lighthouse)
* [Full Testing](#Full-Testing)

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

During development I made use of google developer tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

I utilised the console in the developer tools to work through small sections of JavaScript and ensure that the code was working, and also to troubleshoot where issues were.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools & Firefox inspector tool to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.

To fully test my website I performed the following testing using a number of browsers (google chrome, Firefox & Safari) and devices (Macbook Pro 14 inch, iPhone X, iPhone 11 pro, iPhone 13 pro). Friends and family have also tested the site on their own devices.
